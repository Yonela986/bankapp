## You will be creating a Banking App and applying a random password generator for validation.
Below are the instructions and requirements for the project.

# 1st - The following steps are involved:

Develop a Banking Application capable of making Transfers and Withdrawals in the program, track these transactions, and update the bank statement. This project utilizes Python to read, write, and add to existing 
files to produce an interactable file. Use Exceptions to avoid errors that could be caused by user input, such as ValueErrors produced from a user trying to add letters into a bank account instead of numbers. 
Variables should be kept localized to avoid complications and make actions explicit. Combine sourced information legally & cohesively. Show responsibility for your own learning, manage your time & learning strategy.

# Minimum Project Requirements:
A Bank application with 2 txt files:

BankData.txt to keep all your bank information e.g., money you have in your account. 
TransactionLog.txt to keep your transactions e.g., your withdrawals and transfers.

# Your bank application should ask the following questions when the user interacts with it:

"Would you like to make a transaction?" (Yes or No) 
"Would you like to make a withdrawal or transfer?" (Yes or No) 
Display the current balance every time at this stage. 
"How much would you like to transfer?" or "How much would you like to withdraw?"

After all transfers or withdrawals, the user must be able to see the current balance. When the user enters incorrect information, the application should display "You provided an invalid input."

# 2nd - Your outcomes for the password generator will include the following:
Write a random password generator in Python. Be creative with how you generate random passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the code is run resulting in a new password. The length of the characters should be 12. Include your code in a main method.

# NB. When creating a GUI Application using Python-Tkinter, please ensure that:

The user can simply create their account and login in order to manage their bank accounts, The user can register his/her account by providing details such as username, opening balance and pin number. 
After that, the user has to provide those details in order to access their account. The user can view his/her transaction details, balance inquiry, credit and debit amount. By entering a certain amount only, 
the user can credit or debit amounts. From this type of application, a user can simply manage his personal accounts with fewer efforts.
